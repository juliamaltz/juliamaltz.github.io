      <h1 class="title">About Me</h1>
      <p>My name is Julia Maltz. I am a senior at Saint Joseph's University in Philadelphia, PA. I have a double major in Communications and Digital Studies and Spanish and a double minor in Advertising + Promotions and Linguistics.</p>
      <p> I love the communications industry and consider Public Relations my passion. I dream of pursuing a career at a full-house agency in a big city.</p>
      <p>I was born and raised in West Philadelphia. I love the city and chose to stay here for college. I love animals, writing, the outdoors, reading, spending time with friends and my sisters, and wasting my time watching too many crime TV shows.</p>
